# SamTester
A few lines of code which makes testing your code easier than before

write a code to generate testcases and name it gen.cpp,
write another one to generate correct answer from given input (Slow Version) and name it checker.cpp,
put your code in prog.cpp,
then make a new folder and put all these things into it,
then compile and run SamTESTER using C++11 or earlier.

Your Are All Done, Just Give A Number to it!!
